This page intends to provide an overview of all tools that are included with the current MITK Diffusion Installer and refer to the respective Plugin in the MITK Diffusion application (if one exists).
For a detailed list of parameters call the according tool without any arguments (see \ref MiniAppExplainPage for details on this) or refer its Plugin equivalent.

\section Preprocessing Preprocessing Tools


\subsection DiffDicomLoad Diffusion Dicom Loader

Loads Diffusion DICOM Files and creates NRRD or Nifty file.


\code
  $./MitkDiffusionDICOMLoader -i /home/dcmFolder/ -o /home/outputfile.nrrd
  $./MitkDiffusionDICOMLoader -i /home/dcmFolder/ -o /home/outputfile.nii
\endcode


\subsection RegDicomLoad Regular Dicom Loader

\code
  $./MitkDicom2Nrrd  -i /home/dcmFolder/ -o /home/outputfile.nrrd
  $./MitkDicom2Nrrd -i /home/dcmFolder/ -o /home/outputfile.nii
\endcode




\subsection SecFolderRegistration Folder Registration

Allows to register a series of images (of different modalities, including diffusion weighted) to one reference image. It allows to register derived resources (e.g. a segmentation on
a T2 image) using the transformation of the original (T2) image.

For the following examples assume  a folder containing a longitudinal study with T1,T2, DWI images and segmentations (ROI) :

\code
Patien01_2010-1.dwi
Patien01_2010-1_T1.nrrd
Patien01_2010-1_T2.nrrd
Patien01_2010-1_ROI.nrrd
Patien01_2010-2.dwi
Patien01_2010-2_T1.nrrd
Patien01_2010-2_T2.nrrd
Patien01_2010-2_ROI.nrrd
Patien01_2010-3.dwi
Patien01_2010-3_T1.nrrd
Patien01_2010-3_T2.nrrd
Patien01_2010-3_ROI.nrrd
Patien01_2010-4.dwi
Patien01_2010-4_T1.nrrd
Patien01_2010-4_T2.nrrd
Patien01_2010-4_ROI.nrrd
\endcode

All T2 and DWI images are to be co-registered to the first T2 image, this can be achieved by the following two calls:

\code
  $./MitkRegistration -i /home/inputFolder/ -o /home/outputFolder/  -f Patien01_2010-1_T2.nrrd -m T2.nrrd
  $./MitkRegistration -i /home/inputFolder/ -o /home/outputFolder/  -f Patien01_2010-1_T2.nrrd -m .dwi
\endcode

The segmentations where performed on the T1 image and are therefore related to the image space of the respective T1 image,
so they can be bound to these images by marking them as derived resources. To register them both you would call

\code
 $./MitkFolderRegistration -i /home/inputFolder/ -o /home/outputFolder/  -f Patien01_2010-1_T2.nrrd -m _T1.nrrd -d _ROI.nrrd -b
\endcode

\note the suffixes of '_T1.nrrd' and '_ROI.nrrd' must have the same length!

The parameter -b designates the derived resource as binary such that a nearest neighbor interpolation is used.

All images (execpt for DWI files) are resample to the reference image, to resample to a specific spacing append the desired
spacing like this (e.g. 1 x 1 x 2 mm)

\code
 $./MitkFolderRegistration -i /home/inputFolder/ -o /home/outputFolder/  -f Patien01_2010-1_T2.nrrd -m .dwi -r 1,1,2
\endcode

\note Registration methods assume that both images occupy roughly the same space. It may happend that this is not the case,
and therefore registration fails. In this case you can try the -c option which uses the same origin for both images.


\subsection CopyGeometry Copy Geometry

Copies the geometry (origin) of the source image to the target image.
This is useful in cases where rounding errors in geometries cause the following itk error:
itk::ERROR: ImageToImageFilter(): Inputs do not occupy the same physical space!

For images with differing extent the --alignCentroid option will adapt the origin of the input image such that the centroids of both images align,
this can be as a preprocessing steo for registratering images that do not overlap at all
(e.g. error : Joint PDF summed to zero )


\subsection ImageResampler Resampling of Images

This tool can be used to resample images in different ways. One way is by specifying the spacing.
Transforming an image test.nrrd to have a spacing of 1x1x3 mm can be done using this command:

\code
 $./MitkImageResampler -i test.nrrd -s 1,1,3 -o resampledImage.nrrd
\endcode

Alternatively this program can be used to resample by reference. This will resample the input image to the grid provided by the reference image
and also ensure they occupy the same physical space (that is the input image will have the same origin and voxel dimensions)

\code
 $./MitkImageResampler -i test.nrrd -r referenceImage.nrrd -o resampledImage.nrrd
\endcode

\note Resampling by reference image can also be applied to MR Diffusion data (.dwi files).



\subsection TensorRecon Tensor Reconstruction
See \ref QmitkDiffusionImagingUserManualTensorReconstruction for the GUI equivalent of this tool.

Takes a .dwi, .fsl/.fslgz file as input and saves the computed reconstructed tensor to the specified file.
It also allows for a threshold to be set, to exclude low b values from the reconstruction process.

\code
$./MitkTensorReconstruction -i /home/user/sample.dwi -o /home/user/tensors.dti -t 50
\endcode

\subsection QballRecon  Qball Reconstruction

See \ref QmitkDiffusionImagingUserManualQBallReconstruction for the GUI equivalent of this tool.

\code
./MitkQballReconstruction -i /home/user/sample.dwi -o /home/user/tensors.qbi -t 50 -r .006 -shc /home/user/coeffs.csv
\endcode

\subsection PeakExtraction Peak Extraction

Extracts ODF peaks from the given spherical harmonics coefficient image. Input image type is an image that contains a vector with the spherical harmonics coefficients as pixel type: Image< Vector< float, (ShOrder*ShOrder + ShOrder + 2)/2 + ShOrder >, 3 >

\subsection PeakAngularErr Peak Angular Error

Calculates the angular error between two sets of input directions. The directions are stored as images. Each image voxel contains one direction vector. Such images are for example the output of the fiber direction extraction miniapp.

\section DiffusionMeasures Diffusion Related Measures

\subsection DiffusionIndices Diffusion Indices

See \ref QmitkDiffusionImagingUserManualQuantification for the GUI equivalent of this tool.

Computes a selected tensor derived indices (fa, gfa, ra, ad, rd, ca, l2, l3, md) given a
Tensor, Q-ball or FSL/MRTrix SH-coefficient image. E.g. to compute the fraction anisotropy call

\code
./MitkDiffusionIndices -i /home/user/input.dti -idx fa -o /home/user/fa_image.nrrd
\endcode

\subsection AllDiffusionIndices Tensor Derived Maps Extraction

Similar to \ref DiffusionIndices . But computes all of the following indices FA, RA, MD, CA, RD, AD at once.
Also the input is a regular .dwi file, the tensor reconstruction is done implicitly (using a b0 threshold of 50).

\section FibTracking Fiber Tracking and Processing Methods

\li remove short/long fiber tracks
\li apply curvature threshold
